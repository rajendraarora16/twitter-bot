A fun project which tweets 3000+ similar words in twitter. 

During my college session I created this project to have fun with my twitter account. Somehow I found this in my machine and uploading here. Hope you will enjoy.

**USAGE**

 - Visit [https://apps.twitter.com][1] and create your new application.
 - Go to your selected application and generate access token, consumer key and paste it in `random_word.py`

That's it!! play around with it. You are going to have fun in couple of seconds. :)
